# MERN Haiku Web Application

Welcome to the MERN Haiku Web Application! This web platform is designed for creating, sharing, and exploring Haikus, a form of traditional Japanese poetry. The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, with an additional touch of the syllables npm package to assist in syllable counting for Haiku creation.

The site has already been deployed and you can check it out on [https://haicore.netlify.app](https://haicore.netlify.app/)
